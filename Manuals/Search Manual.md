2. [Search by title](#title)
3. [Search by body](#body)

## Search by tag <a name = "tag"></a>

When a user wants to search for a page they will have 3 options
The first is search by tag, meaning the indexed page tags so they don't have to endlessly scroll
You simply select the dialog bubble for tag and search the tag you are looking for, results will populate

## Search by title <a name = "title"></a>

Second is title which works the same way except by page title

## Search by body <a name = "body"></a>

Finally you have body which again works the same but instead by page body.
These searches are often longer

# Tip

It should be noted you have to reclick the dialog bubbles each time you search
