# Team Rules
Communicate frequently with team members, but if you encounter a serious issue inform the team leader ASAP (NO SURPRISES).

Follow and meet deadlines and milestones set as a team, in the event you will not meet your deadline inform the team leader ASAP and at least 24 hours in advance of the deadline.

Attend all weekly meetings, and inform the team leader ASAP and at least 24 hours in advance that you can not attend.

Make sure to inform the team leader before committing any changes to the 'main' branch of the GitHub repository.
